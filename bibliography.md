1. <details><summary> This excellent 21-page 2020 scholarly article entitled <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14686996.2020.1848213">“Recent Progress in the Conversion of Biomass Wastes into Functional Materials for Value-added Applications”</a> reviews the literature from the last five years to provide an in-depth introduction to our topic:  biomass conversion. </summary>

    <pre>
    - In this reading they talk about research within 5 years including
        * Natural polymers
        * Biomass wastes
        * Using carbon materials as
            * Absorbents
            * Catalyst carriers
            * Electrode materials
            * Functional composites
    - Going into the third paragraph, they write about different examples of biomass including
        * Wood
        * Ag waste peels
        * Biochar
            - Online def: black carbon produced from biomass sources
                * wood chips
                * plant residues
                * manure
                * other agricultural waste products
    - Agricultural waste and biomass wastes that come from ag are produced  over  hundred million tons per year.
    - They also stated that coffee industries produce over 7 million tons of coffee grounds coffee pulp and cherry hush which ends up causing disposal problems
    - crop straw (Cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin)
    - rice husk(cellulose (25–35%), hemicellulose (18–21%), lignin (26–31%) and silica (15–17%)) peanut shells, corn cob(contains 39–45% of glucan, 25–35% of xylan, 17–21% of lignin)
    - Natural polymers can be used instead of synthetic polymers which come from fossil resources.
        * Within all of these natural resources, the different types of polymers that come from them are often  overlooked
    - Overview of first reading: This text was meant to highlight newer ways of using natural resources other than having them dumped in landfills.  There are still some uses for biomass that have not been fully explored.

1. <details><summary>This 60-page 2019 document entitled <a href="pdfs/biomassForPower.pdf" class="image fit">“Biomass for power, fuels (and bio-products) in California”</a> produced by the “SB 100 Joint Agency Report: Charting a path to a 100% Clean Energy Future” seems to be a slide deck presented at a California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) workshop gently arguing against the prevailing sentiment that biomass energy should be eliminated in the state of California. This argument is made in the context of Senate Bill 100 (or SB100) “requiring renewable energy and zero-carbon resources supply 100 percent of electric retail sales to end-use customers by 2045.” It’s evidence-based, thorough and can be found in the background reading module.</summary>

    <pre>
    - The SB 100 policy mandates that California will achieve 100 percent renewable energy and zero-carbon resources for electric retail sales to end-use customers and state agencies by December 31, 2045, while ensuring that the transition does not lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions within the western electricity grid.
    - The transition to a zero-carbon electric system faces challenges in sectors such as aviation, long-distance transport, industrial materials, and maintaining highly reliable electricity. Energy-dense liquid fuels derived from biofuels or advanced synthetic processes present potential solutions to these challenges.
    - Achieving high reliability in a power sector heavily reliant on variable renewables requires storage solutions or flexible generators with low fixed costs. Alternatives and innovations are essential to ensure grid stability and reliability.
    - California's biomass resources, including forest, urban, and agricultural biomass, offer transformation pathways for generating power, fuels, and bioproducts. These resources can be integrated to create a more sustainable energy system.
    - The utilization of solid fuel biomass in California involves a variety of agricultural and food processing residues, clean urban wood, and forest product residues. While biomass steam plants were initially constructed to mitigate pollution from open burning, they currently face challenges related to cost, efficiency, and perception of pollution. However, the significant availability of woody biomass from expanding tree and vine acreage presents opportunities for power, liquid fuel, and biogas production, while also reducing emissions from open burning and maximizing resource utilization.

    <pre>
    - Most “answers” for sustainability, things ‘every day people’ can do, are not cut & dry, one-fits all answers that are attainable for everyone
        - Ie buying an energy-efficient car, recycle bottles and cans, or vote
            -“if you are among those people in the world blessed with cars, bottles, cans, or elections”
        - There are five essential tools which any society that hopes to survive over the long term must utilize:
            - Visioning
            - Networking
            - Truth-telling
            - Learning
            - Loving
        - If a small group of people are persistent and consistent with the application of these then they have the potential to produce enormous change, perhaps producing a revolution
            -Revolution being defined as a large scale social, behavioral, and educational change
        - Visioning:
            - Imagining, first general then with increasing specificity, what you really want
                -Removing any and all restraints of “feasibility”
        - Networking:
            - A network is nonhierarchical, it is a web of connections among equals, held together not by force, obligation, material incentive, or social contract, but by shared values and the understanding that some tasks can be accomplished together that could never be accomplished separately.
        - Truth-telling:
            - Instead of giving information with negative undertones try to use positive ones
            - A warning about the future being a predication of doom vs a warning about the future as a recommendation to follow a different path
        - Learning:
            - Learning means the willingness to go slowly, to try things out, and to collect information about the effects of actions, including the crucial but not always welcome information that the action is not working
        - Loving:
            -Individualism and short-sightedness are the greatest problems of the current social system, we think, and the deepest cause of unsustainability. Love and compassion institutionalized in collective solutions is the better alternative.

    <pre>
    - Biomolecules, biosystems, biomachines, and biocomputing are all emerging and evolving technologies, and are being adapted for commercial use.
    - Approximately 60% of physical inputs to the global economy could be produced biologically: about one-third are biological materials and the remaining two-thirds are non-biological.
    - Biotechnology advancements and currently feasible applications could be valued up to $4 trillion a year over the next 10 to 20 years.
    - Very serious risks exist with new biological capabilities and there needs to be an established proactive, rather than reactive approach moving forward.
    - There are 3 stages from lab to market: scientific research, commercial availability, and diffusion at scale.
    - Bio-literacy will need to be instituted across populations for effective risk-reward mitigations.
    - Research and development is shifting from discovery by accident to rational design.
    - Biological precision applications are advancing in medical and agricultural sciences.
    - Gene editing of human and non-human organisms show promise for increased food production and drought resistance, gene driving, and disease vector mitigation, however, there are significant ecological risks, both known and unknown, that need to be addressed.
    - Automation and AI are being employed to dramatically reduce R&D costs and throughput times.
    - Roughly 30% of private sector R&D could be in industries employing some kind of biological means of analysis, inputs, and production.
    - Current primary domains involving biotechnology research and innovation are health and agriculture.
    - Over the next 10 to 20 years, more than half of the biotechnology impact will likely be in agriculture and consumer products.
    - Over time, fully recognized biotechnology applications could address 45% of the global health burden.
    - As discoveries and advancements commence, adjacent technologies and industries may further enhance adoption speed, reduce costs, and spur rippling changes throughout global economies.
    - Knock-on economic effects may augment broader economic forces caused by increased lifespans, better health outcomes, repurposed land and commercial real estate, and rising retirement ages.
    - Biology is self-replicating, is self-sustaining, and does not respect jurisdictional boundaries.
    - The interconnected nature of biology can increase the potential for unintended consequences.
    - Low barriers to entry open the door to potential misuse with potentially fatal consequences.
    - Differing value systems make it hard to forge consensus, including on life-and-death issues.
    - Privacy issues are, and will continue to be, ongoing issues as questions about who really owns DNA sequences, genetic information, brainwave data, and eventually thoughts.
    - Socioeconomic disparities will provide unequal access to new medical technologies and may further divide the wealthy from the poor at all scales.
    - Biotechnology creation and adoption follows three broad phases: scientific research, commercialization, and diffusion.
    - Diffusion of responsibility is especially important, due to inherent risks.
    - Value propositions will play a significant role in adoption, feasibility, and cost effectiveness as emerging technologies come into the open market.

The 2016 <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/bioenergy/2016-billion-ton-report">“Billion Ton Report”</a> was the third of three studies and reports undertaken by the U.S. Department of Energy to assess the availability of biomass for energy production. It finds that U.S. biomass has the potential to replace 30% of American’s fossil fuel use. This web page has a two-minute video introduction, links to all of the reports, and fact sheets.  The video and fact sheets provide nice snapshots, and if you want to go deeper, “Volume 1: Economic Availability of Feedstocks” is linked and has a 12 page executive summary.

    - Restoring the climate one meal at a time
    - Crowd funded grants are given to farmers to allow them to switch to renewable farming practices
    - How it works:
        - Consumers send 1% of every purchase from a ZFP business – often just a few cents
        - ZFP optimally and equitably distribute restore grants to farmers applicants for healthy soil projects
        - Local trusted conservation experts estimate the climate benefit, and help implement and verify carbon farming projects
    - A mere 2% increase in the carbon content of the planet’s soils could offset 100% of all greenhouse gas emissions going into the atmosphere
        - “Plants absorb carbon from the sky and turn it into sugars to eat and feed the soil which sustains their growth. (Basically, plants can transform “bad carbon” greenhouse gases in the atmosphere into “good carbon” in the form of soil biology, pulling that carbon back down where it belongs: underground)”
            - “The more living things in the soil, and the deeper the root systems, the more carbon gets sucked down from the sky”
        - There is a movement among farmers and ranchers who want to switch from extractive to renewable practices but many farmers can’t afford to take the leap
            - In 2018, American farmers lost about $60/acre before subsidies and only made $20 per acre after subsidies
                - Farmers using regenerative practices don’t qualify for subsidies
            - Cost for farmers to transition to sustainable practices is high and they do not have many options for funding.

    - "the last 5-years average of the world pistachio production amounted to just above 250 Mton"
    - In the intro they spoke about how because of the shells being peeled on the sites getting of the shells is easier.
    - Pistachio Hulls have been used as absorbents in removing pollutants  including:
        - naphthol green B (NG-B)
        - phenol red (PH-R) dye
        - Methylene blue
        - Remazol red
    - There was a study done by Yetilmezsoy and demirel in 2008, using raw Antep pistachios to absorb lead
    - In 2010 Moussavi and Barikbin did studies on removing chromium VI from synthetic wastewaters using raw pistachios
    - Biochar is also another product that can be created by pistachio hulls and shells
    - These points also apply to
        - Cashews
        - Pecans
        - Castor seed hull

    <pre>
    - The US nut industry is growing. The market for nut byproducts is not.
    - Torrefaction is a thermochemical process used to improve physicochemical properties of biomass for energy and their applications.
    - The process consists of thermal treatment of biomass at 200 and 300c in the absence of oxygen.
    - Torrefied biomass exhibits higher hydrophobicity and calorific value with reduced moisture absorption making it a better fuel source for energy than raw biomass.
    - The heat treatment removes most of the hemicellulose and amorphous cellulose but leaves the lignin mostly intact.
    - Products from biomass torrefaction: permanent gas composed mostly of CO2 and CO; a condensable liquid , composed mostly of water, organic acids,  aldehydes, and phenolic compounds; and a carbonized solid referred to as torrefied biomass. 
    - The condensate can be used as a herbicide, pesticide, Fungicide, insecticide and repellent.
    - Typically the torrefied biomass results in solid yields over 50%.
    - Almond processors have reported paying disposal fees of $11-27 per metric ton to dispose of excess shells.
    - A few studies have been done to assess torrefaction and they show that torrefaction is a successful alternative to just incinerating the shells.
    - Utilization of torrefied biomass includes pretreatment for energy products, soil amendment, soil remediation, sorbent and filtration media, filler or additive in composites, carbon black substitute, precursor for activated carbon, and as a source for carbon sequestration.
    - Torrefaction can produce products with similar or improved properties to biochar with better energy input and cost.
    - For energy products torrefaction can decrease transportation and storage costs of biomass by improving properties like moisture content prior to transportation.
    - Biomass energy provides 5 times more than wind and solar globally.
    - Torrefaction pretreatment benefits: reduced moisture of biomass ; lower oxygen-to-carbon ratio, increasing heating value of the biomass; higher hydrophobicity;  and improved ignitability, reactivity, and grindability.
    - Torrefaction found to be more efficient then pelletization and pyrolysis.
    - Has potential to reduce the cost of bio power/fuel.
    - Torrefied biomass as a filler in composites improves biocomposites mechanical and thermal properties.
    - Increased temp results in increased carbon content, reduced hydrogen and oxygen but lower yields.
    - Torrefaction removes moisture first, then hemicellulose, then cellulose than lignin.

    <pre>
    - As a vital component of the University of California system-wide Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources, our mission encompasses the dissemination of scientifically grounded insights, expert guidance, and valuable insights into funding avenues, all in support of advancing biomass utilization endeavors across the expanse of California.
    - California's vast expanse spans approximately 100 million acres, with nearly 40 percent of its territory designated as forested regions, encompassing an array of ownerships including National Forest System lands, privately held, tribal, state-owned, and other federal government-managed areas.
    - Forest activities such as logging, thinning, and ecosystem restoration generate substantial woody biomass, with a substantial portion left within the forests. The accumulation of residual materials like mastication debris and timber slash, when scattered, amplifies wildfire risks by augmenting dry surface fuels, underlining the necessity for alternative management approaches.
    - The challenge of economically extracting woody biomass from forests often necessitates significant subsidies or compromises, as the cost-effectiveness of removal frequently requires sacrificing more valuable resources like saw logs, further emphasizing the complexity of sustainable forestry practices.
    - Sawmills offer a pragmatic and cost-efficient reservoir of readily accessible woody biomass, consisting of bark, sawdust, wood chips, wood shavings, and cull logs. This versatile material finds utility across multiple sectors, from powering plants and crafting landscape amendments to producing compost, animal bedding, pulp, and panel boards, showcasing its multifaceted potential for enhancing various industries while mitigating ecological concerns.

    <pre>
    - The bio-economy uses renewable biological resources from land and sea to produce food, feed, materials, chemicals, fuels, and energy. It is not a new idea but an old idea that historically was employed in the production of bread, cheese, and wine through fermentation.   
    - In recent years, bio-products have been increasingly produced, sold, and used by industries. Within the United States, 4 million jobs and 2,500 USDA certified biomass-based products were 
    - Evonik Industries is a German industrial corporation investigating biomass-based chemicals with $13 billion in sales in 2016.5 In that same year, the company started a $600 million commercialization campaign of bio-surfactants; this is surface-active biomolecules produced from microorganisms with variety of applications. Europe’s approach on bioproducts mainly centers on the processing technology of bioproducts. The bio-economy is thriving now, but the future holds more in store. Many bioenergy firms are still in their R&D stages.
    - Bio-products should build on the idea that one’s waste is another’s input. 
    - Institutions matter and the development of the industrialeducation complex that support R&D in these sectors will have significant effects on its development. Institutions that support these industries should be probed and better understood.

    <pre>
    - The San Joaquin Valley in California plays a crucial role in the U.S. agricultural sector, contributing nearly 12% of the U.S. agricultural gross domestic product. It is also a primary source of petroleum and natural gas for the state.
    - Despite its agricultural significance, the San Joaquin Valley faces a severe air quality problem, with some of the worst air quality levels in the U.S. This poses a significant health hazard to local residents, as it fails to meet compliance standards for five of six ambient air pollutants.
    - Farmers in the San Joaquin Valley resort to illegal open burning of excess agricultural residues due to the lack of viable disposal options. This practice contributes to the region's air pollution issues, even though fines of up to $500 per acre are imposed.
    - San Joaquin Renewables, LLC aims to address the issues of air pollution, excess agricultural waste, and the shortage of cellulosic biofuels by building and operating a biomass energy facility near Bakersfield, California. The facility will produce Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) from sustainable almond orchard waste wood and nut shells, offering a cleaner alternative to open burning and generating valuable RNG transportation fuel. 
    - The proposed biomass energy facility will employ Frontline BioEnergy's Biomass into Natural Gas (BING™) process, which utilizes patented gasification technology and proprietary methanation catalyst. This technology allows for more efficient and cost-effective production of RNG from biomass compared to other cellulosic biofuel processes. The success of this initiative is expected to have positive environmental and economic impacts, reducing waste, improving air quality, and providing returns for investors.

    <pre>
    - A 2018 study out of Brazil estimated that in 2013, there was a total of 5.5 billion tons of crop residues globally.
    - When harvesting and processing cacao, for every pound of cacao seed, 12 pounds of excess waste material is produced.
    - Researchers in Colombia have found ways to use the waste to make beer, juice, pudding-like deserts, and nutraceuticals.
    - They have also found a way to incorporate some of the cacao plant waste, through extraction, into chocolate bars and are replacing some of the traditionally used sweeteners and emulsifiers.
    - A French project Glopack is using spoiled fruit juices, cattle manure, wheat straw and grapevine shoots as feedstocks for biodegradable polymers in packaging.
    - Australian researchers are looking for new pigments used in food and cosmetics derived from fruits and vegetables.

Bio-plastics replace single-use plastics which Americans use in abundance;  the article states that while India produces 5.5 million tons of plastic waste per year, The U.S., which has four times as many people as India, creates 31 million tons of plastic.  We create 25 times as much plastic waste per capita then Indians.  Let’s pursue this one and figure out how to create biodegradable packaging materials right here at MJC.</summary>

    <pre>
    - Bio-lutions, a German based company, uses Mulberry plant scraps to create eco-friendly and biodegradeable food packaging
        - A sister company has began efforts in India to attempt to combat the estimated 15,000 tons of plastic that are created every day, roughly 5.5 million tons per year
            - In comparison, the US produced 31 million tons of plastic waste in 2010
    - Leaves are shredded and dried for two days before being cleaned, mixed with water, and converted into self-binding fibers in a patented machine. Additional water and centrifugal force are applied to the material to create a pulp which is then put through a forming machine and hot press to create the final packaging tray.
    - This company also uses wheat and rice straw, sugarcane leaves, banana stems, pineapple leaves, and tomato plants
    - The factory uses just 3.7 to 5.3 quarts of water for every 2 pounds of product
        - No chemicals are added and very little energy is used for the process
    - Their products biodegrade in about 3 months.

    <pre>
    - Biomass electricity produced by combusting or decomposing biomass matter
    - Biomass components include: cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, lipids, proteins, simple sugars, starches, water, ash, hydrocarbons, etc.
    - Anaerobic digestion:
        - Digester produces methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) from organic matter which is decomposed by anerobic organisms in an airtight lagoon
        - 3 steps: decomposition; conversion of decomposed matter to organic acids; conversion of acids to methane gas
        - Demonstrated use in with agricultural waste and treating municipal/industrial wastewater (examples: Knudsen and Sons project wastewater treatment; Langerwerf Dairy plug flow digester)
        - “Reduces odor and liquid waste disposal problems”
    - Programs policies such as Senate Bill 771 (old) and Public Interest Energy Research (PIER) provide funding for R&D involving biomass power generation.
    - Landfill Gas (LFG) Power Plants:
        - Collection system drilled into landfill which captures mainly methane gas
        - The EPA monitors landfills closely for fires, explosions, and air pollution emissions by authority of the Clean Air Act
        - LFG facilities provide solution to environmental and safety issues by collecting and using gas for power generation and/or heating
        - 1988 legislation prevents LSG from being sold to gas utilities and/or corporations
        - “Generally fewer permitting issues” for LSG recovery facilities compared to other MSW*-to-energy facilities due to them being located at existing landfills
    Municipal Solid Waste:
        - Processing methods: mass burn, refuse derived fuel, pyrolysis/thermal gasification
        - “Tipping fee”: MSW facilities are paid by fuel suppliers to take fuel
    *MSW: Municipal Solid Waste

    <pre>
    - 1 million tons of peanuts produced in Argentina
    - Prodeman, a Cordoban peanut producer, generates 70 gigawatt-hours of electric power, annually, which is produced by solely burning agricultural waste from peanut production
    - 1 hectare of peanuts = 1.1 tons of peanut shells
    - 1 ton of peanut shells produces 1.25 megawatt-hours (MWh) of electricity – Peanut shells have high calorific value (17,570 kg)
    - Baling peanut shells is the only treatment – densifies material, enables sourcing from a larger radius
    - Peanut shells burned in water tube boiler to produce high pressure steam which powers turbine
    - Ash, which is byproduct of the burning, is used to produce bricks
    - The power plant complies with provisions of the 2015 Paris Agreement
    - Prodeman recieved funding from Argentina based on use of “an abundant waste product”, “low additional process energy”, “short distances to consumers”, and "low logistic costs” – Prodeman’s power plant cost $1.9 million USD/MW
