1. <details><summary> This excellent 21-page 2020 scholarly article entitled <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14686996.2020.1848213">“Recent Progress in the Conversion of Biomass Wastes into Functional Materials for Value-added Applications”</a> reviews the literature from the last five years to provide an in-depth introduction to our topic:  biomass conversion. </summary>

    <pre>
    - In this reading they talk about research within 5 years including
        * Natural polymers
        * Biomass wastes
        * Using carbon materials as
            * Absorbents
            * Catalyst carriers
            * Electrode materials
            * Functional composites
    - Going into the third paragraph, they write about different examples of biomass including
        * Wood
        * Ag waste peels
        * Biochar
            - Online def: black carbon produced from biomass sources
                * wood chips
                * plant residues
                * manure
                * other agricultural waste products
    - Agricultural waste and biomass wastes that come from ag are produced  over  hundred million tons per year.
    - They also stated that coffee industries produce over 7 million tons of coffee grounds coffee pulp and cherry hush which ends up causing disposal problems
    - crop straw (Cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin)
    - rice husk(cellulose (25–35%), hemicellulose (18–21%), lignin (26–31%) and silica (15–17%)) peanut shells, corn cob(contains 39–45% of glucan, 25–35% of xylan, 17–21% of lignin)
    - Natural polymers can be used instead of synthetic polymers which come from fossil resources.
        * Within all of these natural resources, the different types of polymers that come from them are often  overlooked
    - Overview of first reading: This text was meant to highlight newer ways of using natural resources other than having them dumped in landfills.  There are still some uses for biomass that have not been fully explored.

1. <details><summary>This 60-page 2019 document entitled <a href="pdfs/biomassForPower.pdf" class="image fit">“Biomass for power, fuels (and bio-products) in California”</a> produced by the “SB 100 Joint Agency Report: Charting a path to a 100% Clean Energy Future” seems to be a slide deck presented at a California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) workshop gently arguing against the prevailing sentiment that biomass energy should be eliminated in the state of California. This argument is made in the context of Senate Bill 100 (or SB100) “requiring renewable energy and zero-carbon resources supply 100 percent of electric retail sales to end-use customers by 2045.” It’s evidence-based, thorough and can be found in the background reading module.</summary>

    <pre>
    - The SB 100 policy mandates that California will achieve 100 percent renewable energy and zero-carbon resources for electric retail sales to end-use customers and state agencies by December 31, 2045, while ensuring that the transition does not lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions within the western electricity grid.
    - The transition to a zero-carbon electric system faces challenges in sectors such as aviation, long-distance transport, industrial materials, and maintaining highly reliable electricity. Energy-dense liquid fuels derived from biofuels or advanced synthetic processes present potential solutions to these challenges.
    - Achieving high reliability in a power sector heavily reliant on variable renewables requires storage solutions or flexible generators with low fixed costs. Alternatives and innovations are essential to ensure grid stability and reliability.
    - California's biomass resources, including forest, urban, and agricultural biomass, offer transformation pathways for generating power, fuels, and bioproducts. These resources can be integrated to create a more sustainable energy system.
    - The utilization of solid fuel biomass in California involves a variety of agricultural and food processing residues, clean urban wood, and forest product residues. While biomass steam plants were initially constructed to mitigate pollution from open burning, they currently face challenges related to cost, efficiency, and perception of pollution. However, the significant availability of woody biomass from expanding tree and vine acreage presents opportunities for power, liquid fuel, and biogas production, while also reducing emissions from open burning and maximizing resource utilization.

The complete report “includes a review of the policy to provide 100 percent of electricity retail sales and state loads from renewable and zero-carbon resources in California by 2045. The report assesses various pathways to achieve the target and an initial assessment of costs and benefits. The report includes results from capacity expansion modeling and makes recommendations for further analysis and actions by the joint agencies.”  The recommendation is made to exclude “electricity generated from combustion of biomass and fossil fuels, including natural gas.”</summary>

    - Most “answers” for sustainability, things ‘every day people’ can do, are not cut & dry, one-fits all answers that are attainable for everyone
        - Ie buying an energy-efficient car, recycle bottles and cans, or vote
            -“if you are among those people in the world blessed with cars, bottles, cans, or elections”
        - There are five essential tools which any society that hopes to survive over the long term must utilize:
            - Visioning
            - Networking
            - Truth-telling
            - Learning
            - Loving
        - If a small group of people are persistent and consistent with the application of these then they have the potential to produce enormous change, perhaps producing a revolution
            -Revolution being defined as a large scale social, behavioral, and educational change
        - Visioning:
            - Imagining, first general then with increasing specificity, what you really want
                -Removing any and all restraints of “feasibility”
        - Networking:
            - A network is nonhierarchical, it is a web of connections among equals, held together not by force, obligation, material incentive, or social contract, but by shared values and the understanding that some tasks can be accomplished together that could never be accomplished separately.
        - Truth-telling:
            - Instead of giving information with negative undertones try to use positive ones
            - A warning about the future being a predication of doom vs a warning about the future as a recommendation to follow a different path
        - Learning:
            - Learning means the willingness to go slowly, to try things out, and to collect information about the effects of actions, including the crucial but not always welcome information that the action is not working
        - Loving:
            -Individualism and short-sightedness are the greatest problems of the current social system, we think, and the deepest cause of unsustainability. Love and compassion institutionalized in collective solutions is the better alternative.

1. <details><summary>McKinsey Global Institute’s 25 page executive summary of their 2020 report entitled <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/life%20sciences/our%20insights/the%20bio%20revolution%20innovations%20transforming%20economies%20societies%20and%20our%20lives/mgi_the%20bio%20revolution_executive%20summary_may%202020.pdf"> “The Bio Revolution: Innovations Transforming Economies, Societies, and our Lives”</a> This report is about the emerging bio economy but unlike the Schmidt report, this one highlights risk factors. </summary>

    <pre>
    - Biomolecules, biosystems, biomachines, and biocomputing are all emerging and evolving technologies, and are being adapted for commercial use.
    - Approximately 60% of physical inputs to the global economy could be produced biologically: about one-third are biological materials and the remaining two-thirds are non-biological.
    - Biotechnology advancements and currently feasible applications could be valued up to $4 trillion a year over the next 10 to 20 years.
    - Very serious risks exist with new biological capabilities and there needs to be an established proactive, rather than reactive approach moving forward.
    - There are 3 stages from lab to market: scientific research, commercial availability, and diffusion at scale.
    - Bio-literacy will need to be instituted across populations for effective risk-reward mitigations.
    - Research and development is shifting from discovery by accident to rational design.
    - Biological precision applications are advancing in medical and agricultural sciences.
    - Gene editing of human and non-human organisms show promise for increased food production and drought resistance, gene driving, and disease vector mitigation, however, there are significant ecological risks, both known and unknown, that need to be addressed.
    - Automation and AI are being employed to dramatically reduce R&D costs and throughput times.
    - Roughly 30% of private sector R&D could be in industries employing some kind of biological means of analysis, inputs, and production.
    - Current primary domains involving biotechnology research and innovation are health and agriculture.
    - Over the next 10 to 20 years, more than half of the biotechnology impact will likely be in agriculture and consumer products.
    - Over time, fully recognized biotechnology applications could address 45% of the global health burden.
    - As discoveries and advancements commence, adjacent technologies and industries may further enhance adoption speed, reduce costs, and spur rippling changes throughout global economies.
    - Knock-on economic effects may augment broader economic forces caused by increased lifespans, better health outcomes, repurposed land and commercial real estate, and rising retirement ages.
    - Biology is self-replicating, is self-sustaining, and does not respect jurisdictional boundaries.
    - The interconnected nature of biology can increase the potential for unintended consequences.
    - Low barriers to entry open the door to potential misuse with potentially fatal consequences.
    - Differing value systems make it hard to forge consensus, including on life-and-death issues.
    - Privacy issues are, and will continue to be, ongoing issues as questions about who really owns DNA sequences, genetic information, brainwave data, and eventually thoughts.
    - Socioeconomic disparities will provide unequal access to new medical technologies and may further divide the wealthy from the poor at all scales.
    - Biotechnology creation and adoption follows three broad phases: scientific research, commercialization, and diffusion.
    - Diffusion of responsibility is especially important, due to inherent risks.
    - Value propositions will play a significant role in adoption, feasibility, and cost effectiveness as emerging technologies come into the open market.

1. Read around in this 80-page white paper which was published by Schmidt Futures in 2022 entitled <a href="https://www.schmidtfutures.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Bioeconomy-Task-Force-Strategy-4.14.22-4.pdf"> “The U.S. Bioeconomy: Charting a Course for a Resilient and Competitive Future.”</a> This report is motivated by the fear of losing the race to dominate the burgeoning bio economy and provides development strategies. 

1. This 64-page 2023 report entitled <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bold-Goals-for-U.S.-Biotechnology-and-Biomanufacturing-Harnessing-Research-and-Development-To-Further-Societal-Goals-FINAL.pdf"> “Bold Goals for U.S. Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing”</a> is published by the White House per executive order. Like the McKinsey and Schmidt reports, it charts a course for establishing a new economy. From the Executive Summary:  “This report on climate change solutions provides an overview of ten bold goals and associated R&D needs to safely harness rapid developments in biotechnology and biomanufacturing to dramatically decrease GHG emissions, increase carbon sequestration, and develop innovative products.”

1. The 2016 <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/bioenergy/2016-billion-ton-report">“Billion Ton Report”</a> was the third of three studies and reports undertaken by the U.S. Department of Energy to assess the availability of biomass for energy production. It finds that U.S. biomass has the potential to replace 30% of American’s fossil fuel use. This web page has a two-minute video introduction, links to all of the reports, and fact sheets.  The video and fact sheets provide nice snapshots, and if you want to go deeper, “Volume 1: Economic Availability of Feedstocks” is linked and has a 12 page executive summary.

1. <a href="https://www.zerofoodprint.org">Zero Foodprint</a> is an organization that supports food producers as they zero out their carbon emissions, so it's not directly involved in biomass conversion industry though they support sustainable biomass practices. Many resources are available under the tabs entitled “About,” “Carbon Farming,” and “News.”

    <pre>
    - Restoring the climate one meal at a time
    - Crowd funded grants are given to farmers to allow them to switch to renewable farming practices
    - How it works:
        - Consumers send 1% of every purchase from a ZFP business – often just a few cents
        - ZFP optimally and equitably distribute restore grants to farmers applicants for healthy soil projects
        - Local trusted conservation experts estimate the climate benefit, and help implement and verify carbon farming projects
    - A mere 2% increase in the carbon content of the planet’s soils could offset 100% of all greenhouse gas emissions going into the atmosphere
        - “Plants absorb carbon from the sky and turn it into sugars to eat and feed the soil which sustains their growth. (Basically, plants can transform “bad carbon” greenhouse gases in the atmosphere into “good carbon” in the form of soil biology, pulling that carbon back down where it belongs: underground)”
            - “The more living things in the soil, and the deeper the root systems, the more carbon gets sucked down from the sky”
        - There is a movement among farmers and ranchers who want to switch from extractive to renewable practices but many farmers can’t afford to take the leap
            - In 2018, American farmers lost about $60/acre before subsidies and only made $20 per acre after subsidies
                - Farmers using regenerative practices don’t qualify for subsidies
            - Cost for farmers to transition to sustainable practices is high and they do not have many options for funding.
