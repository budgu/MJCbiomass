1. <details><summary> This excellent 21-page 2020 scholarly article entitled <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14686996.2020.1848213">“Recent Progress in the Conversion of Biomass Wastes into Functional Materials for Value-added Applications”</a> reviews the literature from the last five years to provide an in-depth introduction to our topic:  biomass conversion. </summary>

    <pre>
     In this reading they talk about research within 5 years including
        * Natural polymers
        * Biomass wastes
        * Using carbon materials as
            * Absorbents
            * Catalyst carriers
            * Electrode materials
            * Functional composites
    - Going into the third paragraph, they write about different examples of biomass including
        * Wood
        * Ag waste peels
        * Biochar
            - Online def: black carbon produced from biomass sources
                * wood chips
                * plant residues
                * manure
                * other agricultural waste products
    - Agricultural waste and biomass wastes that come from ag are produced  over  hundred million tons per year.
    - They also stated that coffee industries produce over 7 million tons of coffee grounds coffee pulp and cherry hush which ends up causing disposal problems
    - crop straw (Cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin)
    - rice husk(cellulose (25–35%), hemicellulose (18–21%), lignin (26–31%) and silica (15–17%)) peanut shells, corn cob(contains 39–45% of glucan, 25–35% of xylan, 17–21% of lignin)
    - Natural polymers can be used instead of synthetic polymers which come from fossil resources.
        * Within all of these natural resources, the different types of polymers that come from them are often  overlooked
    - Overview of first reading: This text was meant to highlight newer ways of using natural resources other than having them dumped in landfills.  There are still some uses for biomass that have not been fully explored.

1. <details><summary>This 60-page 2019 document entitled <a href="pdfs/biomassForPower.pdf" class="image fit">“Biomass for power, fuels (and bio-products) in California”</a> produced by the “SB 100 Joint Agency Report: Charting a path to a 100% Clean Energy Future” seems to be a slide deck presented at a California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) workshop gently arguing against the prevailing sentiment that biomass energy should be eliminated in the state of California. This argument is made in the context of Senate Bill 100 (or SB100) “requiring renewable energy and zero-carbon resources supply 100 percent of electric retail sales to end-use customers by 2045.” It’s evidence-based, thorough and can be found in the background reading module.</summary>
    <pre>
    - The SB 100 policy mandates that California will achieve 100 percent renewable energy and zero-carbon resources for electric retail sales to end-use customers and state agencies by December 31, 2045, while ensuring that the transition does not lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions within the western electricity grid.
    - The transition to a zero-carbon electric system faces challenges in sectors such as aviation, long-distance transport, industrial materials, and maintaining highly reliable electricity. Energy-dense liquid fuels derived from biofuels or advanced synthetic processes present potential solutions to these challenges.
    - Achieving high reliability in a power sector heavily reliant on variable renewables requires storage solutions or flexible generators with low fixed costs. Alternatives and innovations are essential to ensure grid stability and reliability.
    - California's biomass resources, including forest, urban, and agricultural biomass, offer transformation pathways for generating power, fuels, and bioproducts. These resources can be integrated to create a more sustainable energy system.
    - The utilization of solid fuel biomass in California involves a variety of agricultural and food processing residues, clean urban wood, and forest product residues. While biomass steam plants were initially constructed to mitigate pollution from open burning, they currently face challenges related to cost, efficiency, and perception of pollution. However, the significant availability of woody biomass from expanding tree and vine acreage presents opportunities for power, liquid fuel, and biogas production, while also reducing emissions from open burning and maximizing resource utilization.
