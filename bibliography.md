1. <details><summary> This excellent 21-page 2020 scholarly article entitled <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14686996.2020.1848213">“Recent Progress in the Conversion of Biomass Wastes into Functional Materials for Value-added Applications”</a> reviews the literature from the last five years to provide an in-depth introduction to our topic:  biomass conversion. </summary>

    - In this reading they talk about research within 5 years including
        * Natural polymers
        * Biomass wastes
        * Using carbon materials as
            * Absorbents
            * Catalyst carriers
            * Electrode materials
            * Functional composites
    - Going into the third paragraph, they write about different examples of biomass including
        * Wood
        * Ag waste peels
        * Biochar
            - Online def: black carbon produced from biomass sources
                * wood chips
                * plant residues
                * manure
                * other agricultural waste products
    - Agricultural waste and biomass wastes that come from ag are produced  over  hundred million tons per year.
    - They also stated that coffee industries produce over 7 million tons of coffee grounds coffee pulp and cherry hush which ends up causing disposal problems
    - crop straw (Cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin)
    - rice husk(cellulose (25–35%), hemicellulose (18–21%), lignin (26–31%) and silica (15–17%)) peanut shells, corn cob(contains 39–45% of glucan, 25–35% of xylan, 17–21% of lignin)
    - Natural polymers can be used instead of synthetic polymers which come from fossil resources.
        * Within all of these natural resources, the different types of polymers that come from them are often  overlooked
    - Overview of first reading: This text was meant to highlight newer ways of using natural resources other than having them dumped in landfills.  There are still some uses for biomass that have not been fully explored.
