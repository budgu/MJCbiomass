1. Is there a local source of feedstock to meet Aemetis ethanol needs?  
1. Smaller waste streams, agricultural crops that are grown in or imported into California may be overlooked because of their smaller volume  
1. Some, or perhaps many, biomass wastes may not have a high-value alternative use.  
1. Many areas of the Ag community have systems in place to utilize the excess biomass on their farms. However, there are untapped sources of biomass, like cattails, and water hyacinth 
1. How can we use biomass that is not used in feedstock to create products?   
1. There are limits to the management of Municipal Solid Waste in local areas due to the lack of a recycling plant in Stanislaus County  
1. Municipalities find it too expensive to transform existing landfills into landfill gas producers which capture biogas.  
1. How to manage biomass in such a way as to improve the quality of water within local communities (like finding a replacement to nitrate fertilizers or using biochar to chelate).  
1. Almond hulls and shells are currently not valuable even though they are 75% of what almond growers produce.  
1. How can we recover biomass from school cafeterias?   
1. How to get manure into a safe, usable form since it may contain E. Coli or salmonella  
1. Farmers can't afford equipment to turn woody biomass into woodchips  
1. There is a lack of some agricultural materials in the area, for example those needed for dairy feed  
1. Synthetic fertilizer causes farmers to need to use more fertilizer  
1. Why are orchards paying someone to ground up their trees for mulch/compost when there are monetizable alternative uses for woody biomass?  
1. Farmers have a lot of woody biomass they don't know what to do with  
1. Biomass moisture content presents problems for transportation and storage  
1. For almond farmers, unit cost per acre has gone down due to the increase in input costs, taxes, and regulations. This means that farmers are having trouble paying the bills since they aren’t making a profit  
1. How can Christmas trees be repurposed?  
## Manufacturing/Technology/Business 
1. Biofuel factories cost a lot to build and may not be very profitable.

1. Too many innovators get stuck in "pilot" stage of their company  
1. This tri-county region may not be attractive enough to lure the necessary talent that can build these bio-manufacturing facilities.  
1. Employers consistently express frustration over the accessibility, responsiveness, and alignment of supports in sourcing mid-skill talent across industries and occupations. (Pulled directly from Stan 2030 report, page 11.)  
1. The County has relatively weak institutional capabilities in research, development, and commercialization that can bring value-add products to market or provide firms with a problem-solving partner to anchor them in the region. (Pulled directly from Stan 2030 report, page 11)  
1. Biotechnology is inherently dangerous, and should something go wrong, our community could be ground zero for an ecological disaster.

1. Successfully integrating innovative methods into the handling of biomass disposal or diversion within industrial settings requires a meticulous consideration of operational intricacies and potential disruptions.  
1. Many pioneering entrepreneurs find themselves entangled in the "pilot" phase of their ventures primarily due to the scarcity of available investment opportunities and grants. Overcoming this hurdle necessitates a comprehensive strategy that addresses funding gaps, fosters investor confidence, and propels innovative biomass initiatives toward commercialization. 
1. The act of patenting traditional knowledge or biological resources can potentially lead to biopiracy, a concern particularly relevant to indigenous and local communities. By appropriating these invaluable assets without adequate recognition or compensation, such patenting practices compromise both ethical considerations and the sustainable preservation of diverse cultural and ecological heritage. 
1. How can biomass be used as feed for black soldier fly larvae  
1. The younger demographic of San Joaquin Valley means that we have a less experienced and less skilled workforce.

1. We lack a streamlined process from high school into the workforce 
1. How can we better educate farmers, gardeners, and landscapers of the benefits of biochar and second-hand compost? 
1. How can we get the community involved in these projects? 
1. The 4th industrial revolution of bio-based technology needs to be contextualized for outsiders. Is it new technology or just new applications?  
1. There is a lack of respect for nature in the area. Many people benefit off of nature but do not give back and do not protect what is in existence. 
1. The Ag and Biology depts at MJC need to engage in building a biotech program at school 
1. Farmers need to become aware of potential resources, like trees and methane, that are wasted in their farms operations

1. Nursing program is in high demand, leading to a long waitlist with many students waiting to be accepted. These students are interested in health and have taken the science prereqs, and they could possibly be attracted to other jobs in biotech if it were advertised 
1. Local and county officials' awareness about the biotech industry is not high enough to secure funding and bring business to the area 
1. Environmental Justice Groups have an outsized voice and shut down discourse causing insufficient public information which blocks biomanufacturing progress  
1. Enochs High School has a biotech/forensics program but risks losing their funding due to not being able to get enough at-risk students into the program. They have a full curriculum developed, but have not expanded to other schools. 
1. Hiring (HR) groups in schools, non-profits, and companies need to be publicizing jobs with biotech industries 
1. Biotech companies should be building relationships with homeless worker organizations which can provide good jobs for Stanislaus County’s vast homeless population.
