                <h3>Upstream</h3>
               <li>Transportation of the weight of biomass is expensive. Converting it needs to be local. </li>
               <li>Costs of transportation can become excessive </li>
               <li>Most municipal waste is not recycled properly </li>

               <li>As a dairy farmer, a big company is suspicious </li>
               <li>Small dairy farmers don't have access to digesters </li>
               <li>Money is available for establishing digestors but grant writing is complicated </li>
               <li>Is there a local source of feedstock to meet Aemetis ethanol needs? </li>
               <li>Smaller waste streams, agricultural crops that are grown in or imported into California may be overlooked because of their smaller volume </li>
               <li>Some, or perhaps many, biomass wastes may not have a high-value alternative use. </li>
               <li>Many areas of the Ag community have systems in place to utilize the excess biomass on their farms. However, there are untapped sources of biomass, like cattails, and water hyacinth</li>
               <li>How can we use biomass that is not used in feedstock to create products?  </li>
               <li>There are limits to the management of Municipal Solid Waste in local areas due to the lack of a recycling plant in Stanislaus County </li>
               <li>Municipalities find it too expensive to transform existing landfills into landfill gas producers which capture biogas. </li>
               <li>How to manage biomass in such a way as to improve the quality of water within local communities (like finding a replacement to nitrate fertilizers or using biochar to chelate). </li>
               <li>Almond hulls and shells are currently not valuable even though they are 75% of what almond growers produce. </li>
               <li>How can we recover biomass from school cafeterias?  </li>
               <li>How to get manure into a safe, usable form since it may contain E. Coli or salmonella </li>
               <li>Farmers can't afford equipment to turn woody biomass into woodchips </li>

               <li>Why are orchards paying someone to ground up their trees for mulch/compost when there are monetizable alternative uses for woody biomass? </li>
               <li>Farmers have a lot of woody biomass they don't know what to do with </li>
               <li>Biomass moisture content presents problems for transportation and storage </li>
               <li>For almond farmers, unit cost per acre has gone down due to the increase in input costs, taxes, and regulations. This means that farmers are having trouble paying the bills since they aren’t making a profit </li>
               <li>How can Christmas trees be repurposed? </li>
                <h3>Manufacturing/Technology/Business </h3>

               <li>This tri-county region may not be attractive enough to lure the necessary talent that can build these bio-manufacturing facilities. </li>
               <li>Employers consistently express frustration over the accessibility, responsiveness, and alignment of supports in sourcing mid-skill talent across industries and occupations. (Pulled directly from Stan 2030 report, page 11.) </li>
               <li>The County has relatively weak institutional capabilities in research, development, and commercialization that can bring value-add products to market or provide firms with a problem-solving partner to anchor them in the region. (Pulled directly from Stan 2030 report, page 11) </li>
               <li>Biotechnology is inherently dangerous, and should something go wrong, our community could be ground zero for an ecological disaster. </li>
               <li>Are there alternatives to corn which provide an equally efficient and inexpensive way for companies to produce ethanol for biofuel? </li>

               <li>Dairy farmers who don't have a biodigester let the methane go into the atmosphere </li>
               <li>Successfully integrating innovative methods into the handling of biomass disposal or diversion within industrial settings requires a meticulous consideration of operational intricacies and potential disruptions. </li>
               <li>Many pioneering entrepreneurs find themselves entangled in the "pilot" phase of their ventures primarily due to the scarcity of available investment opportunities and grants. Overcoming this hurdle necessitates a comprehensive strategy that addresses funding gaps, fosters investor confidence, and propels innovative biomass initiatives toward commercialization.</li>
               <li>The act of patenting traditional knowledge or biological resources can potentially lead to biopiracy, a concern particularly relevant to indigenous and local communities. By appropriating these invaluable assets without adequate recognition or compensation, such patenting practices compromise both ethical considerations and the sustainable preservation of diverse cultural and ecological heritage.</li>
               <li>How can biomass be used as feed for black soldier fly larvae </li>
               <li>The younger demographic of San Joaquin Valley means that we have a less experienced and less skilled workforce.  </li>
               <li>How can we access and then test out research done in university settings?</li>
               <li>Plastic serves an important role in keeping food products sanitary for consumers. New bio-made plastic alternatives will need to adequately serve the same purpose. </li>

               <li>How to reduce the costs of making eco-friendly products. </li>
               <li>We don’t have a big enough workforce to do biotech since it has been outsourced to other countries such as in Europe, China, and Brazil </li>
               <li>Advanced Biofuels Process Development Unit (ABPDU) at Laurence Berkeley Lab (LBL) can’t keep people employed at the company since employees are getting poached to other companies. There is a lack of highly trained/qualified people in the industry </li>
               <li>Most of the workers with the interest, passion, or education to be hired at biotech companies for research positions are commuting out of the Central Valley </li>
               <li>In order to create an industry here we need workers, but to bring workers back we need an industry.</li>

               <li>Agriculturalists (Gardeners, landscapers, and farmers) need to be educated on the value of “spent compost” or second use compost for their soil. (Monterey Mushroom substrate) </li>
               <li>How can we expose young children to biotech education and influence their path from a young age </li>
               <li>we need a future educated workforce in advance of when we need them, but we are uncertain of what that workforce looks like and how it differs from our current workforce</li>

               <li>the production process of bio-based products is new and the public lacks the education on these materials and therefore are hesitant to allow bio </li>
               <li>We lack a streamlined process from high school into the workforce</li>
               <li>How can we better educate farmers, gardeners, and landscapers of the benefits of biochar and second-hand compost?</li>
               <li>How can we get the community involved in these projects?</li>
               <li>The 4th industrial revolution of bio-based technology needs to be contextualized for outsiders. Is it new technology or just new applications? </li>
               <li>There is a lack of respect for nature in the area. Many people benefit off of nature but do not give back and do not protect what is in existence.</li>
               <li>The Ag and Biology depts at MJC need to engage in building a biotech program at school</li>

               <li>Biotechnology is not a commonly understood or talked about industry</li>
               <li>Need intermediary between farmers and companies who can provide answers and demystify farmer’s concerns (Ph levels, does methane stink) regarding bioindustrial products like biochar or ethanol</li>
               <li>Nursing program is in high demand, leading to a long waitlist with many students waiting to be accepted. These students are interested in health and have taken the science prereqs, and they could possibly be attracted to other jobs in biotech if it were advertised</li>
               <li>Local and county officials' awareness about the biotech industry is not high enough to secure funding and bring business to the area</li>
               <li>Environmental Justice Groups have an outsized voice and shut down discourse causing insufficient public information which blocks biomanufacturing progress </li>
               <li>Enochs High School has a biotech/forensics program but risks losing their funding due to not being able to get enough at-risk students into the program. They have a full curriculum developed, but have not expanded to other schools.</li>
               <li>Hiring (HR) groups in schools, non-profits, and companies need to be publicizing jobs with biotech industries</li>
               <li>Biotech companies should be building relationships with homeless worker organizations which can provide good jobs for Stanislaus County’s vast homeless population.</li>
               <li>Farmers don't understand newer bio technology and aren't easily persuaded to adopt it for fear of public scrutiny</li>

               <li>Americans create excessive amounts of plastic waste</li>
               <li>Must maintain agricultural land while building new biotech facilities</li>
               <li>Methane is a bane of the dairy industry</li>
               <li>If carbon digesters only meet part of dairy's carbon neutrality goals how will they meet the rest</li>
               <li>There is no guarantee that some, or many, of the bio-manufacturing jobs will meet the “good jobs” threshold criteria. </li>
               <li>Not all biomass products and processes are clean for the environment</li>
               <li>Many scientists are discouraged from continuing their work because of bureaucratic roadblocks and regulations.</li>
               <li>Certain issues faced by the unhoused community can be diminished using biotechnology to convert agricultural waste into a consumer product.</li>
               <li>Policy makers need to stabilize and streamline permitting process for companies to build biotech facilities like carbon sequestration, anaerobic digesters, biofuel power plants, etc.</li>
               <li>What incentives can be offered from waste management for lower income individuals to afford services needed?</li>
               <li>Some issues faced by low socioeconomic communities could be combated or alleviated by biotechnology practices and innovations.</li>
               <li>The Stanislaus County area is filled with people who enjoy nature and wide open-spaces, building new manufacturing buildings is likely to be faced with push-back</li>
               <li>We are not an area companies want to do R&D in</li>

               <li>There is a decent amount of production jobs in this area but there is an extreme lack of Research and Development</li>
               <li>Why aren’t we using the many vacant warehouses in to help build an bio-economy in Modesto</li>
               <li>There is little coordination between colleges and the local workforce when it comes to bio-manufacturing</li>
               <li>How do we protect the workers in an industry that we may well destroy?</li>
               <li>What can be done to produce more biodegradable plastic products as opposed to petroleum or fossil raw based plastic products.</li>
               <li>Farmers are interested in fallowing, but are unsure if they would be able to pay the bills if they did.</li>
               <li>Laboratories and research institutes, due to scarcity of funding, prioritize funding efforts over input efforts, which leads to lowered productivity and progress.</li>
               <li>Byproducts of biomass processing, such as biocides, potentially introduce more problems than the ones biomass processing is aiming to solve. </li>
               <li>The production process of bio-based products is perceptibly new, the public lacks the education on these materials, and therefore could be hesitant to allow bio manufacturing companies into their cities.</li>
               <li>Intense focus on big ticket industry adoption and inclusion detracts from wider, small to medium scale cottage industry potentials for biomass remediation, such as mycology.</li>
