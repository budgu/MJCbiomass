# MJC should have a course/program focused on beer, wine, and coffee making



In MJC, there seems to be a lack of programs and/or courses that relate to beer, wine, and coffee making. As unusual as it sounds, there are benefits from the knowledge as agriculture is a crucial part of the Central Valley as a whole. In beer brewing, the waste by products consist of spent grains, hot trub, and brewer’s yeast which can be converted into a number of applications such as animal feed and additives, food ingredients and health supplements, and ethanol production. Winery by product includes grape pomace which also has a range of applications such as animal feedstock, substrates for gardens, and the production of bioethanol. For coffee, in addition for its crops using less water than corn and almonds, coffee pomace has some biomass applications such as fertilizer and the production of biofuel.
