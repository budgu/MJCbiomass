# Many agriculturalists aren’t familiar with the benefits of bio char

In the Central Valley, not many agriculturalists are familiar or interested in the benefits of bio char, a carbon rich charcoal. The benefits of bio char include the improvement of fertilizer and nutrient uptake, increases soil water retention, and the reduction of soil acidity. Several reasons as to why that may include cost, lack of awareness, or a mix of both. David Tavares from Pacific Biochar has said one of the issues faced in raising awareness of bio char was a lack of education and/or training with staff. Despite the challenges presented from the company, lessons were learned. Some ways to spread the word of bio char is educating and training staff for companies that specialize in bio char production and cooperating with local farms to raise awareness of bio char to other agriculturalists.
