# Biochar seems too expensive for large scale farmers.

One of our guest speakers came to our workshop to present his experience with a biochar program. They were acquiring biochar from a producer and selling it at $15 for enough biochar for 2.5 square feet at mainly farmers markets and garden shops. This isn’t sustainable for a large-scale farmer with several acres of soil that they need to fertilize. For it to work you would need to cut out the middle man and increase the scale of the operation. There is also a different process called torification that produces a similar and possibly better product at a lower cost. Biochar may be too expensive to produce itself but it is a byproduct of many biomass processes and it is still a useful product especially for home gardens something.
