# What can be done to produce more biodegradable plastic products as opposed to petroleum or fossil-based plastic products

Fossil-based plastics produced about 1.8 billion tonnes of greenhouse gas in 2019. Biobased plastics could save 73 million tonnes of CO2 from going into the air but because of the cost, it isn’t possible. It costs anywhere from $2-$7 dollars to create bio-plastic while it cost under a dollar for the same amount of petroleum-plastic. Due to the prices of manufacturing, biobased products are more expensive for consumers to buy. The emissions going into the air from plastic production obviously has a horrible effect on the environment, but fossil-based plastics are cheap.  It is a problem to convince a company to switch from petroleum-based products to bio-based. There is also the problem where consumers may only be able to afford one over the other. When it comes down to it, the consumers have the ultimate say. If a company is spending a certain amount to create a product but see no income, they may shut down production. I believe the main problem in switching from the use and manufacturing of petroleum/fossil-based plastics to bio-based plastic is the prices.
