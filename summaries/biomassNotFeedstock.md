# How can we use biomass that is not used in feedstock to create products 

When it comes to biomass conversion and bio manufacturing, biomass always has its uses whether it is being researched or already in use. Feedstock is a good example of what biomass can be used for, but sometimes not all biomass can be used in feedstock including sawdust, tree branches, and cardboard and paper waste. An example of a non-feedstock product created by biomass is bio char, which is converted from organic waste via pyrolysis. Another use for biomass is fuel which Aemetis has been producing from agricultural waste like cow manure.
