title: "Biomass Isn't Profitable"

# Some, perhaps many, biomass wastes may not have a high-value alternative use. 

Biomass sources can’t just be “profitable,” they need to be worth the trouble and initial investment. And most biomass, at the moment at least, don’t have any significantly profitable uses and a lot of biomass's only real use is compost. A lot of uses are possible but not economically viable. Biomass products have very stiff competition that is already established. Why build a very expensive factory to conduct a very expensive production to produce a similar or worse product. There still are possibilities in the future as we further develop the science but as of the present moment the fact of the matter is that most biomass isn’t very valuable.
