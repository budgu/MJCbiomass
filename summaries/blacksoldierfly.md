# How can biomass be used as feed for black soldier fly larvae 

Black soldier fly larvae possess a remarkable ability to efficiently convert food waste into valuable high-protein sustenance and hold potential for biofuel production. The United States grapples with a disheartening trend:  over one-third of produced food remains unconsumed  signifying resource wastage. Examining the recycling of green waste uncovers an awareness gap. Few realize that waste sorting at processing facilities is less comprehensive than perceived. Consequently, residual plastics attached to discarded waste find their way into sprawling compost heaps. These, initially meant for environmental enrichment, are latent with microplastics and crushed glass. The core challenge involves optimizing biomass utilization to nourish black soldier fly larvae optimally. Realizing this goal requires heightened vigilance during green waste recycling and stringent contamination checks. The overarching goal is to unlock a self-sustaining cycle: repurposing waste into prized protein resources, addressing food wastage, amplifying protein yields, and advancing biofuel potential.
