# Biotechnology is inherently dangerous, and should something go wrong, our community could be ground zero for an ecological disaster.
 
The idea of biotechnology is amazing, but that does not mean it does not have issues. If something were to go wrong, for example, releasing toxic gasses during biomass conversion, this could really have a horrible impact on the environment. This may be a reason for concern for many citizens here in Stanislaus County.  Communication and transparency is really important when it comes to creating new technology. Having precautionary measures is important but how could we reassure the people who live here?
