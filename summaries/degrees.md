# Biotech degrees/education seem too scientific for industrial and career ed disciplines to teach

Science and math are daunting to many students. To create the thriving biotech labor market which we need to fill the biotech companies in the area, we must overcome the stigmas surrounding the industry. If students can have opportunities to activities and discussions of math and science that excite them, students who thought they would never have a career in a STEM field may identify an interest in biomass conversion. Alongside this, we need to create valuable programs which allow students who are unable to complete advanced math or physics classes the education they need to get a job in the bioindustry which supports a comfortable life. Our students should have the ability to grow with their education. This means learning skills that give them the ability to scale-up in their work. This also means gaining a degree at MJC that allow them to move forward to a 4-year university with a recognized education that meets their standard.
