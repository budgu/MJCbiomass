# Biotech programs losing funding 

Enochs High School has the only biotech/forensics program in the area, but they are currently at risk for losing their funding due to not being able to meet their quota of at-risk students in the program. They have a full district-approved curriculum developed but have not added the forensics program to other schools in the district. Since Enochs is the most affluent school in the Modesto City School district, hitting the at-risk student quota will be more difficult than other schools in low socioeconomic communities. Due to funding cuts, the number of students accepted into the forensics program is being limited. Dave Menshew, founder and developer of the biotech/forensics program, stated that it is hard to find people with the education and passion to want to teach. In his experience, as regulations and rules changed, he needed to acquire extra certifications to teach the same subject he had been teaching for decades. This can be discouraging for current or future teachers.
