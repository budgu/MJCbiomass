# Expanding Communication Channels

In many avenues of advocacy students have been the moving force. Typically, when a school board or some sort of deciding board hears from young people it is very moving and has a major impact. In California, student demand for increased sustainability is not the issue. So many of our young people are at the front of this movement demanding for change on individual, local, state, and federal levels. The issue is that many of them do not have an avenue to expand on this passion. There are many clubs that advocate for other issues and have very well formed structures that could be followed to implement clubs on high school campuses with local college students as mentors. The issue is how we can provide the space to the young people for them to be heard. Additionally, many older aged Gen Z's and most millennials have a strong passion for environmental justice. Although there are organizations at a college level in California that focus on environmental advocacy, many of them do not communicate with one another; and even less within the Central Valley.
