# How can we expose young children to biotech education and influence their path from a young age 

Today’s youth can serve as the prime catalyst for influencing a change in understanding and integration of circular economy principles. However, there are not enough opportunities proliferated throughout all areas of our communities which give children the education that they need in a manner they can understand. Children in urban environments can benefit from a community garden. Stanislaus County’s youth development organizations, such as 4-H and FFA, are specially catered to teach youth in the agricultural community about new sciences and skills which can help them to serve their world in a greater way. These organizations can serve as breeding grounds for a new culture that recognizes the need for conscious action regarding reduction and repurposing of our waste streams. Older generation dairy farmers may be resistant to industrialists or academics telling them that they need an anaerobic digester. However, that child’s grandson or granddaughter who understands the needs of the dairy and the value of the anerobic digester to capture greenhouse gas and deliver a new revenue stream may be able to communicate its value in a way that no one else can. Unfortunately, this process can never happen if no one engages the youth.
