# Extended Producer Responsibility 

Many corporations and organizations have already begun to redesign their production to enhance Extended Producer Responsibility. Gallo wineries, the Mattress Recycling Council, and Coca-Cola are just a few entities leading the charge to reduce waste and enlarge the circular economy. However, more must be done to supplement products, such as packaging, with renewable resources that are not solely paper or petroleum based. There is research taking place to utilize almond hulls and shells as a packaging material. Companies like Natura Mushrooms in Australia are using mushroom mycelium to replace plastic packaging products. Furthermore, bottle manufacturers seek to recycle used plastic, but it downgrades with every use. Almond proteins can serve as a strengthening agent for recycled plastic allowing them to be used longer. Our nation’s companies have a good start; however there are out-of-the-box and unconventional solutions in the bioindustrial sector which should not be ignored.
