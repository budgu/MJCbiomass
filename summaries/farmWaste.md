# We are only converting a small amount of what we have.

On average, California produces 10 million tons of agricultural waste. This waste only includes grass clippings, tree leaves, twigs, and limbs, and vegetable cuttings. The gross amount of our agricultural waste is expected to be much higher. Out of all the raw materials we are left with at the end of many fruit, vegetable, and nut growing processes we are truly only converting and working with a small portion. Many biomass conversion companies have a hard time moving to the commercial scale due to logistics but with the amount of waste we have, there should be no problem with sourcing materials. How do we improve the percentage of ag waste that is converted? Our issue is not having enough of the materials to produce a product, it's a matter of having enough companies to process and produce something out of the waste. With a streamlined system we could single handedly reduce our amount of waste along with increasing the biotechnology industry in the state once again being a leader and pioneer in something, proving ourselves to be an example for other states.
