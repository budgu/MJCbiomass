# Farmers don't understand newer bio technology and aren't easily persuaded to adopt it for fear of public scrutiny 

Farmers are reluctant to adopt newer biotechnology due to a lack of understanding and concerns about public perception. Farming traditions passed down through generations often pose resistance to change. Farmers' hesitance to embrace these technologies stems from reasons ranging from aversion to learning and implementing new practices, to apprehension about public scrutiny over potential unsanitary practices. In an age where even a simple photo can be manipulated through AI-powered tools, farmers' caution towards unfamiliar technologies is justifiable. This challenge unravels the complexities of bridging the gap between advanced biotechnology and traditional farming practices, all while addressing the nuanced aspects of knowledge gaps and public perception.
