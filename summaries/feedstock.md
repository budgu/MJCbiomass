# Companies need access to feedstock

Many companies that specialize in bio manufacturing and biomass conversion as well as farms are in need of easily accessible biomass. In the Central Valley, we produce an abundance of biomass as a result of being a major agricultural hub as we grow around 250 different types of crops. One example of biomass in our area that can be used for feedstock is almond hulls which proves to be effective feedstock for chickens and cows that improves egg and milk production according to UC Davis. Another example would be grape pomace which many wineries like Gallo and Bronco produced and transported for feedstock for local dairy farms.
