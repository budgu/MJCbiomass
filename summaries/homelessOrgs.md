# Biotech companies should be building relationships with homeless worker organizations which can provide good jobs for Stanislaus County’s vast homeless population 

Within Stanislaus County approximately 2,091 members of the community are unhoused and the majority are not able to get jobs because of little job experience or they are sometimes not even given a chance. There are few organizations in the area that offer part time jobs for the unhoused. If new higher paying jobs are created in the city it will only attract those who live outside the city looking for a decent job. What we need is a way to implement new bio-based jobs that are offered to citizens first, specifically those of lower or no income, rather than creating new positions and advertising to surrounding cities about the new potential prospects Modesto may hold for them.
