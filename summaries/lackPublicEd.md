# There is a lack of understanding and education of biotechnology in the general public.

Because biotechnology, bio conservation, and many other sustainable practices are not commonly talked about amongst people outside of the community or industry there tends to be misunderstanding about what the goal is or how the process works. This creates hesitation and roadblocks to implementing new techniques to lower carbon footprint, amounts of products in landfills, and the amount of biomass that is wasted. Starting on a smaller level, doing periodic public education presentations or setting up tables at local colleges to educate students could increase the demand for more sustainability in the Central Valley. Additionally, many high school students have a very basic understanding of environmental science and little to no knowledge of biotechnology which hinders growth into the industry from a young age. The lack of education at a high school level or lower tends to reduce the amount of students who enter the field at a college level and beyond. Students could benefit from more exposure to healthy environmental practice and could possibly be a catalyst of education for their parents. The prevalent stigma surrounding the sciences reduces the amount of trust the public has in biotechnology.
