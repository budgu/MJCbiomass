# Leftover Biomass

Almond farmers have a lot of woody biomass they don't know what to do with. During the year, farmers will collect trees that have fallen down, branches, and sticks into a pile called attrition. Harvesting almonds results in a lot of sticks that farmers will store. The wood biomass can be turned into wood chips that can be used on the farm to prevent dust, but it is very expensive for farmers to rent the wood chip machine. Farmers may resort to burning their attrition pile if they can’t find a use for it.
