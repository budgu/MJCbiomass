# Some issues faced by low socioeconomic communities could be combated or elevated by biotechnology practices and innovations.

The Central Valley has seen a consistent increase in the size of the unhoused population and with the increase in size, resources have become more scarce. There is a general stigma surrounding unhoused communities that tends to lead to a lack of community support, understanding, and awareness. The creation of these social issues surrounding the unhoused populated have only exacerbated the problems faced by community members. Some of the problems faced by the community includes a lack of hygiene products, lack of blankets, lack of shelter products, lack of considerations, and lack of personal products. Additionally, the Central Valley has a very high concentration of agricultural waste and byproducts that are otherwise being unused. This agricultural waste includes but is not limited to almond tree scraps, walnut tree scraps, corn husks, and the remnants of clear cut orchards. The agricultural waste produced by the Central Valley could be repurposed to create consumer products to alleviate the scarcity of products that are available to the unhoused community.
