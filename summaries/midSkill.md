# Trouble with mid-skill talent:

A struggle which employers within the bioindustrial sector are facing is to fill their positions with capable individuals, particularly at the mid-skill level. Established companies like Aemetis are experiencing strange occurrences of interviewing applicants for a position, hiring them, but they never show up to work. To combat this, employers must redesign their hiring process to recognize that experienced men and women have transferable skills that align with the positions offered in the biotech industry. These include “hidden workers” and “STARs”, aka individuals Skilled Through Alternative Routes, who do not have the traditional credentials of a bachelor’s degree but are equipped and ready to take on new challenges. Biomass conversion is a topic which professionals are passionate and eager to become involved in. In spite of this, positions go unfilled because employers have their scopes too narrow.
