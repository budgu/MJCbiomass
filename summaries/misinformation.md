# There is a lot of misinformation and stigma surrounding the science community which creates setbacks in education, awareness, and outreach. 

With the unfettered access we all have to the internet, it is easy to come across information that may be untrue or accurate in some aspects but not in another. The prevalence of inaccurate information and negative perceptions creates substantial hurdles across education, awareness, and outreach efforts. As a consequence, the public's understanding of science is distorted, obstructing its potential positive impact. The challenge demands a multifaceted approach. First, dispelling misinformation through accessible and accurate communication channels is essential. This entails breaking down complex concepts into relatable information, ensuring that the public receives not only credible knowledge but also information that can be retained. Educational institutions play a vital role in addressing this challenge by revising the current curriculum to emphasize critical thinking and scientific literacy. By fostering an environment where questions are encouraged and scientific processes are demystified, the foundations for a more informed society can be laid.
