# The Stanislaus county area is filled with people who enjoy nature and wide open-spaces; building new manufacturing buildings is likely to be faced with push-back 

The Stanislaus Area was once a wetland abundant with water and wildlife throughout the region. In the late 1800s, people began building houses as well as farming. The area is now filled with millions of harvested acres spread throughout thousands of farms. The prospect of new businesses coming to Modesto and creating thousands of jobs is promising but raises the question: where will these businesses be built? In a town that was once dominated by agriculture, which is still prevalent in today's times, residents are wary when confronted with the idea of huge manufacturing companies being built here, despite the concept of thousands of jobs being created to provide stable income opportunities. The community's culture is very nature-oriented and is not likely to change anytime soon. If bio-manufacturing companies intend to build their factories here, they must be willing to incorporate themselves in a way that aligns with the community's ideologies and aspirations.
