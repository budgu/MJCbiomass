# People in Stanislaus County don't necessarily know about or feel the need for biotech. 

There is a lack of awareness and misconceptions around biotech and its applications in daily lives. With the vast amounts of biomass readily available in our county we have a unique opportunity to convert this mass into something useful, but our residents lack the knowledge on these technologies and therefore are wary of incorporating these products and practices into their daily lives. With new policies coming into effect over the next several years, we must change our attitudes towards biotech and its place in our lives.
