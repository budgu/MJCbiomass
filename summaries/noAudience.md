# People with potentially good ideas do not have an easily accessible and identifiable forum or audience in which to present their ideas.

With ever-encroaching levels of technology creating clever avenues into our daily lives, a global attention economy continues to grow at an alarming rate. Social media companies, the gaming and entertainment industries, the 24/7 news cycles, and sports broadcasting are all common, daily examples of entities whose primary resource supplying their bottom line is our attention. Couple that with the economic and social ails of modernity placing increasing demands just to survive, and it’s no wonder that many vitally important issues and topics fall by the wayside. Every single day, people around the world come up with great ideas, potential solutions to problems large and small. Arguably, most end up dismissed and released back in the ether; some end up on a blog, a YouTube channel, or a social media post. Those few people with adequate amplification capital might gain some traction through larger attention-dominant platforms, like TedX, or through personalities, like Joe Rogan or Jordan Peterson. Centralized and censorship-free access to a platform addressing solutions is sorely lacking and is desperately needed, especially at the community level. The average person needs an easily identifiable pathway towards solution amplification and dissemination to hopefully divert finite attention resources away from disposable outlets and into constructive projects.
