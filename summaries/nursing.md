# Opportunities for students in other fields

Nursing is a well-respected, in-demand, stable, and high salary career. The nursing program at MJC is very popular among students, leading to a long waitlist with many students waiting to be accepted. The nursing program accepts 80% of students with the highest scores and 20% based on random lottery selection. Students who don’t get accepted have to wait until the next semester to apply, giving them a gap semester. During this time, students may seek out new opportunities or pursue a career change. Since nursing students are interested in health, science, and have taken the necessary science prerequisites, they could possibly be attracted to jobs in biotech if it were advertised.
