# There is a lack of research on organic fertilizing practices
One of the biggest areas of research that still needs to be expanded on according to an almond grower, which is also an ethical issue for them, is the study of organic soil amendments. Currently there is a lot of research done on synthetic soil amendments and nutrients but there is an extreme lack of data on their organic counterparts. The issue with this is that it makes it harder for farmers to know how much of every compound is in the soil at any given moment. Synthetic compounds have very specific amounts and they are able to pull exact numbers from the products so they can monitor how much nitrogen is in the soil. Organic compounds differ based on temperature and other factors which creates more work for the farmers when it comes to monitoring and data collection. Many organizations are pushing for organic produce and calling for the elimination of synthetic product use in regards to pesticides and fertilizer but there is little to no funding towards said research. The growers want to move towards converting more of their orchards to organic systems but the lack of knowledge about the soil amendments and the unpredictability of the products makes it difficult for them to make that change.
