# Nurturing Economic Inclusivity: Bridging the Path to Biotech Careers 

In the local counties, a significant obstacle to creating a more inclusive, accessible, and growing economy is the lack of a clear pathway connecting high school education to biotech careers. This situation doesn't just maintain current economic disparities but also limits the area's potential for development and variety. The absence of a direct route to biotech careers especially affects people from marginalized backgrounds. The lack of accessible educational options makes it hard for them to enter the biotech workforce, leading to a cycle of economic inequality and limited chances. This challenge has major economic consequences. Without a smooth transition from education to biotech careers, the local economy misses out on diverse viewpoints, new ideas, and vital talent. This prevents the sector from becoming a driving force for economic growth. Furthermore, the unclear pathway acts as a barrier, making it difficult for those without enough resources or guidance to enter the biotech industry. This not only denies opportunities to individuals but also restricts the economy's growth potential by excluding untapped talent.  By establishing a direct and supportive route from high school education to biotech careers, the region can access a wider pool of talent, create fair opportunities, and foster both individual success and economic progress.
