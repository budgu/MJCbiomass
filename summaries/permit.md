# Permits take a lot of time and resources to understand and get processed. 

These permits cover many different fields that all require consultation with experts of those fields. This costs a great deal of money but even worse it costs a great deal of time, something vital for fixing the climate crisis. And permits play a vital role in our government and legal system and yet the system is messy, overly confusing and slow. There are no specialists for permits and the system is poorly constructed and handled. The amount of time needed to just decipher and understand the permits themselves is a big enough problem and now you need to talk to five different specialists just so you know what you need to do. This is extremely inefficient and a waste of valuable time.
