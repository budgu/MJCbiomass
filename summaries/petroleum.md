# Petroleum Products are more cost effective than biomass products.
The production, transportation, and storage of biomass are all more expensive than petroleum products, and the infrastructure is already there giving producers even less incentive to invest in biomass. Another reason biomass is a less enticing option than petroleum is that biomass is simply more of a hassle to deal with; its organic nature makes it less reliable and more, for lack of a better word, “tricky” to deal with. You have to deal with things like rot, moisture, disease and also none of this sounds good to the consumer especially when environmental extremists use buzz words like disease, rot, and death in articles on why biomass is actually cruel. Petroleum is consistent, familiar, and efficient. Currently there are few concrete reasons for investors and producers to invest in biomass.
