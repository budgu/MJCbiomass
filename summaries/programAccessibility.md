# Biomanufacturing and biotechnology programs should be more accessible to more schools and colleges. 

In Modesto, we have a biotech/forensics program at Enochs High School yet it is only offered at one high school. At UC Merced, there is a bioengineering degree. Modesto Junior College and Stanislaus State have not implemented a program yet for biotech. Jim Dekloe started his own curriculum and degree for biotech at Solano Community College, where students start working at local facilities, like Genentech, soon after they graduate.
