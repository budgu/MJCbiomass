# To expand biotechnology and replace existing processes, current jobs will be destroyed or replaced. This will then create a large-scale job shortage.

In order to make progress in the biotechnology industry there is a need to replace, or eradicate, existing processes to make way for new innovations, techniques, and research. In doing so one ultimately kills a lifeline for another person:  the job that is helping them support themselves and their family. The risk in doing this is creating a younger generation, the children of those who were negatively impacted by the expansion of biotechnology, who grow up learning that biotechnology is evil and put their family in a dire situation. In doing this we reduce understanding, support, and awareness of the true mission of biotechnological advancements. If we create an industry that will take jobs away, it must create new ones to give back. The beauty of biotechnology is that it is a growing industry that has the means and potential to do just that except for the gap in education and training that would have to be closed if someone were to go from working in a garbage processing plant to managing a closed-circuit garbage burning system. There is work that needs to be done on a multi-tiered level in order to meet the needs of our community.
