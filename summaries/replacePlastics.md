# What can we do to replace plastics

Plastic is among the one common waste in the United States, about 12%. Unlike most forms of waste, plastic is very difficult to manage as it breaks down into micro plastics, which has been proven to be a toxic pollutant that infests our oceans as well as the bodies of many living organisms including us humans. Despite the major challenge of managing plastic waste production and the commodity of non-degradable and/or partially degradable plastic items, there are some potential ways to replace plastics via biomass conversion. Alternatives being looked at include: recycled paper and cardboard; hemp, which is a drought tolerant plant that doesn’t require fertilizers and replenishes soil quality as it grows; mushrooms like reishi which emulate the collagen structure of animal leathers; and sunflower hulls although still being looked at do show promise in being used for the production of bioplastics.
