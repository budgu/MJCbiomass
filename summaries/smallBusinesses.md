# Besides large businesses, there is a lack of small businesses that produce bio-based products 

Breaking into the biomass industry is a fickle process. It can be expensive and time consuming and is usually only viable for a large entity due to the intricate and resource hungry process. It not only requires innovative ways of transmuting biomass into a product that can be sold for profit, but there must also be a market for said products. Despite being in an area uniquely positioned in an area abundant with several sources of biomass feedstocks, the public is still hesitant of bio-based products such as bio plastic, and biogas produced from cows, for fear it will smell like cow manure, which it doesn’t. Not to mention the many policies that then require a business owner to hire a compliance officer so as not to do anything illegal, all of which require more money. This financial burden further tilts the scale against small businesses, limiting their ability to participate in the bio-based products sector.
