# There are currently no science focused summer camps for K-12 students offered in Modesto. 

By exposing young students to biotech curriculum, students learn how to work in a lab, research skills, and how to problem solve. It also would develop a group of students that are interested in pursuing biotech who may choose to advance the program and in turn, tutor younger students on biotech skills. When students have a better idea of what biotech includes and what occurs in the field of biotech, they may be more open to a career in biotech. A summer program/bootcamp for school-aged kids to get hands-on experience with biotech would greatly benefit their learning and lab skills, foster a community around learning biotech, and encourage them to consider biotech from a young age.
