# The biotech industry seems too small for colleges to train students for.

At the present moment the biotech industry is still in a phase of experimentation; the field is still very young and developing. This makes it very difficult to not only convince schools that it is a worthwhile investment but also and even more so to convince people to take the classes. This only stunts the development of the field. And makes an already difficult to understand field even less accessible. The real future of biomass and regenerative processes is in biotech and in order to grow the field and further the science we need students, fresh eyes, passionate, curious minds, and we need a place for them to be able to develop the skills so that they may do that.
