# Biotech companies don’t have a body of trained workers to employ. 
There is no streamlined degree for biotechnology locally and the industry barely even exists at the moment especially in the area, so even if they paid for a bunch of schooling for years there wouldn’t be any jobs for them once they got out thus wasting their time and money. And adding courses and degrees is a long process. But if we don’t get a trained work force soon biotech companies will go where there is one and then the Central Valley will lose out on the early rise of the industry and will always be behind on development in the industry. This is the biggest issue with biotech in the Central Valley. But if we can overcome this major problem the central valley could become the global leader in biotechnological development.
