# Community might be uninterested

Most projects that are heading towards sustainability tend to be more hidden so it might be that community members do not know they exist. It is difficult to promote or advertise such ideas because of the limited audience. Lack of information is a problem when it comes to these types of projects as well. People tend to tune out or lose interest when they do not understand a certain topic. We have been able to see solar power, wind turbines, and hydropower in the works but when it comes to seeing other renewable projects like using biofuel, our knowledge is very limited. If we were to be able to gain more knowledge on the subject, more people or community members could get interested in the topic. That would bring more research on local possibilities and get schools involved in teaching these subjects. This would then allow students to have that option as a future interest. It might even get local farmers and local business owners to get involved. But how could we get them interested?
