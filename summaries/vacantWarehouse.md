# Why aren’t we using the many vacant warehouses to help build a bio-economy in Modesto 

Amid Modesto's ever-evolving landscape, vacant buildings remain an untapped resource. Instead of allowing these spaces to host more fast food joints or eateries, a unique opportunity emerges: the chance to transform them into thriving bio-manufacturing hubs. Interviews with residents revealed concerns about the Stan 2030 agenda and its vision of creating new manufacturing facilities. Utilizing empty warehouses means no demolition or construction on land that is currently vacant of facilities, allowing it to remain a natural habitat.  Modesto's dynamic growth provides a canvas for innovation. Repurposing dormant structures for bio-manufacturing endeavors aligns with sustainable progress. The shift toward an emerging bio-economy holds potential to elevate both job opportunities and environmental stewardship. By harnessing vacant warehouses for bio-manufacturing, Modesto can usher in a transformative era, breathing new life into disused spaces while propelling local economic vitality.
