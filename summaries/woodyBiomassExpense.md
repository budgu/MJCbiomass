# Farmers can't afford equipment to turn woody biomass into wood chips.
Almond orchards every 30 years or so get taken out of the ground, the trees are then usually chipped and spread over the orchard plot to fertilize the soil and the same is done every year when they harvest the almonds and are left with prunings, shells, and hauls. This is a great sustainable process for almond orchards. But there is one big problem with this and that’s that smaller farmers (most farmers) can’t afford the equipment so they either just ship it off somewhere where they will most likely burn it or they have to pay someone who does have the equipment. This is a big expense for farmers that makes what is an already difficult goal even harder to achieve but also an already difficult and unappreciated job even harder.
